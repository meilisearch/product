# Product

Welcome to the MeiliSearch product team repository ðŸ‘‹

## Why ?

This is the place we use to centralize improvements, new features but also make product announcements.

## How ?

Our process is quite simple, we try to validate the exposed problems in order to approach the certainty that solving it will bring a positive impact to you.

## Wait! Where is the delivery track?

If we imagine the different repositories as a supply chain, this one is used for what we call the discovery process. Once the problem has been validated, it can be refined, specified and planned. Next, we move on to the delivery process that takes place in the [search engine](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch) repository.
